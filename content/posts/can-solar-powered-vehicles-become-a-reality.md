#### Introduction

In contrast to the previous century where Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) dominated the transport sector, the current age will be focused on electrifying transportation. In order to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the entire transportation sector globally will have to transition to cleaner fuels. According to IEA, 24% of the cumulative direct CO2 emissions are from the transportation sector, of which, road transportation alone accounts for about three quarters of transport emissions. As per IEA report of 2009, it is expected that we would see a 53% increase in demand for oil from 2006 to 2030 and if this sector continues to be powered by fossil fuels then, nearly 40% of the total demand will be coming from the transportation sector. Several governments and automobile industries are looking for alternate propulsion systems and one of them is electricity.

Shifting to Electric Vehicles (EVs) can help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels which is currently the dominant source of energy for transport. It greatly reduces transport emissions in line with countries’ NDC targets. Various case studies that studied the impact of switching to EVs have shown substantial reduction in vehicular emissions. For these reasons, several countries are drawing up policies to provide a channel for EVs in the market. On a macro scale, Switching to EVs reduces a country’s fuel import bills.

According to the 2019 Air Quality Index report, 21 out of 30 most polluted cities in the world are located in India. Various studies show that in order for India to meet the target of limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2°C set in the Paris Agreement, it would require to decarbonize the energy sector and electrify its transportation sector. During its lifetime, a vehicle contributes to pollution at different stages- production, usage, disposal, electricity generation and fuel production. The total emission of a vehicle over its lifetime depends on the make of the machine and the engine. Shifting to EVs can greatly reduce the emissions in stage 2, i.e. usage and, if the fuel mix is inclined to renewable energy, stage 5 i.e. electricity generation.
