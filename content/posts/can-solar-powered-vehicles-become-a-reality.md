#### Introduction

Burning fossil fuels is one of the major contributors of greenhouse gas emissions since about 81% of all emissions are of CO2. Emissions from transportation significantly contribute to the greenhouse accumulation in the atmosphere. Thus, shifting from fossil fuels to less polluting and cleaner sources of energy would reduce the total GHG emissions from the sector. 

Billions of barrels of oil is used daily to meet energy demand from the transportation sector alone. Oil and gas are a dirty source of energy. If countries are to meet their reduction targets under the Paris Agreement, transportation will need to be cleaned. Recently, oil was traded at negative prices, incentivising countries to fund the development of larger storage facilities. This may be economical in the short run, but even negative oil prices do not reveal its true costs. To understand the true costs of oil, environmental, social, and health externalities and subsidies should be accounted for. 

Shifting transportation to renewables may be the key to unlock not only sustainability but also relieve countries of their economic burden of providing subsidised dirty fuels. 

An alternative to petrol or diesel vehicles is solar powered vehicles. Solar powered cars run entirely on solar energy. There are no Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) or batteries that are charged using grid electricity (from charging stations) in solar cars. Solar powered vehicles sound highly beneficial because solar energy is virtually unlimited and it is a clean alternative  to gas guzzling cars. They are also cost effective since they get abundant energy directly from the sun. The batteries here are solar powered. It can be stored and used later in the night. 

Solar powered cars are currently used only for solar car races where participants are given a chance to explore technologies to build their own solar powered cars with photovoltaic energy.



#### **National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020**

The Government of India published its **National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020** in 2013 with the goal of fast tracking the introduction and manufacture of electric as well as hybrid vehicles in the country. The aim is to have an average of 6-7 million EVs and Hybrid vehicles on sale by 2020. The NEMMP 2020 serves as a guide to all schemes, initiatives and policies for state governments around electric mobility. This Mission Plan stated the four factors that determine the intervention of the transportation sector in environmental degradation- vehicle efficiency, vehicle use, type of fuel used and infrastructure of the vehicle. All of this along with demand creation, research and development, supply incentives, EV infrastructure in the NEMMP 2020.

Under the Phase-I of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric (and Hybrid) Vehicles (FAME-India), around 43 crores rupees were spent on around 500 charging stations/ infrastructure by the Department of Heavy Industries in some cities including Bengaluru, Jaipur, Chandigarh and NCR of Delhi. Under the Phase-II, about 500 crores were spent on 2636 charging stations across cities in all states and UTs. GST for EVs has been reduced from 12% to 5%. Custom duty exemption has been placed on those automobile parts that are used exclusively in EVs. There is also an income tax rebate of up to 1.5 lakh rupees on interest payable loans for EV purchases. However, if the prices of the vehicles remain high at the time of buying, none of the incentives might please an average buyer. For example, Hyundai Kona Electric costs nearly 23.75 lakhs. On the other hand Hyundai Venue S Turbo costs only around 9 – 10 lakhs. Even if EV owners are exempted from paying road taxes, it does not ensure that more buyers would go for EV as their purchasing power at the time of buying is not guaranteed to be high.

**Transition to Electric Mobility in India**

India aims to have only electric vehicles on road by 2030. The Niti Aayog has identified 3 elements that are crucial while implementing transformation in mobility:

1. Integration of transport with electricity.
2. Development of a shared ecosystem platform.
3. Scaling up of manufacturers.

Areas of opportunities have been discussed using these elements in the mobility strategy that has been proposed. This is expected to create a fleet in electric vehicles that not only helps in transportation as and when needed but also in supporting the grid at other times. The implementation of this strategy is divided into 3 phases:

* Phase 1 - use existing opportunities that are economic, prepare for strategic options feasible in near future.
* Phase 2 - improving the preparations from phase 1, encouraging private entity's involvement.
* Phase 3 - government incentives, final goal for integrated transport and supporting grid.

The two main challenges - mobility and electricity availability – are addressed in Niti Aayog’s strategy. The methods to tackle these challenges lie in advancement of technology, innovation in business models and working on behavioural change of the people in the way they commute every day.

However, this strategy does not take into account the impact of manufacturing (both vehicle and battery) on natural resources, impact on oil and gas industries and does not do much regarding behavioural change of the people in their mobility.



#### **Behavioural Changes to Promote of Electric Mobility**

In an academic review done by Rachana Vidhi and Prasanna Shrivatsava, they recommended policies that will be suitable to different socio economic groups relevant to the Indian market. For this reason, they made a division of two groups.

The first group consists of two wheeler owners. According to a case study done by Embarq, a foundation that helps accelerate implementation of sustainable mobility to improve quality of life in cities, 81% of the two wheeler owners in Pune had relied on public transportation for their daily commute before purchasing a two wheeler. They shifted to two wheelers as it is more convenient than public transport. If these two wheeler owners who are sensitive to oil prices had a cheaper alternative provided to them, they would adopt it. As rightly pointed out in the Mission Plan, Indian consumers are highly value conscious and how they can afford goods play an important role in the consumer buying decisions. Therefore, in order to achieve 100% electric mobility, the government will have to provide generous monetary incentives to this group. Right now, smaller cars are purchased more because of the lower excise duties for smaller cars. This is one of the important points to keep in mind while pricing EVs.

The second group consists of those who own four wheelers. They are comparatively less exposed to pollution than those who use public transport and two wheelers. Four wheelers take up 32% of the vehicles on road. Having ownership of a house and a car are symbols of success in our country. The better the car brand, the higher the stature. Car owners are less likely to shift to public transportation as it is less comfortable. By giving up their cars, they will be giving up a material that is considered a status symbol in the society. Therefore, in order to stimulate behavioural changes in this group with regards to mobility, it is necessary to not only give monetary incentives but also social incentives like acknowledgement of the shift in their usage to public transport in local media.



#### **Present conditions in India**

In addition to this, while drawing EV policies, the governments must make sure to keep in mind the reality of the existing conditions in our country. There is no sufficient road infrastructure and although we have surplus energy there are frequent outages. When the number of EVs on road increases, the demand for electricity will also increase. Today, we have petrol and diesel easily available at pumping stations. For EVs, we do not have enough charging infrastructure yet. Speaking of charging infrastructure, another important subject of discussion is where do we get energy from to supply for charging stations? If the fuel mix is relying on fossil fuels, the whole point of EVs reducing the need for oil and gas will be vain. The fuel mix has to be inclined to renewable energy sources. Currently, only 25% of energy generated in India comes from renewable sources, i.e. wind and solar. The proposed strategy does not include a scenario where the energy generated from renewable sources will increase in the future. As of today, EV policy has not achieved as much success as it could have because of lack of awareness among consumers.

Currently, the only type of batteries made to run EVs are lithium-ion batteries or li-ion batteries. Lithium is very effective as it is one of the lightest elements and is highly reactive. However, li-ion batteries in EVs release various pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide in the manufacturing process. Even its disposal is a hassle.

Increase in EVs would mean increased demand for li-ion batteries. According to a 2019 BloombergNEF report, demand for lithium would double every five years reaching 1.6 million tons of lithium carbonate equivalent by 2030. While India has no supply chain on its own, China is dominating the global supply chain for lithium. India relies on lithium imports mostly from China to make battery cells and cathodes. China is also the world’s largest supplier of electric vehicles.

Adding to this, we have not achieved as much as we could have in adopting EVs because of lack of awareness among consumers. All of this makes India’s adoption to EVs a lot slower than was expected.
